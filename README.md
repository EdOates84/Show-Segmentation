# Show-Segmentation
GSoC 2020 project with Red Hen Lab. The goal is to create an algorithm that can automatically split the videos into named show and dated show. Identify anchor/show names or recognizes what show it is. Using the IMDb dataset (Will discuss in the proposal) to identify show names from anchor names (identified using MSCeleb). We Split the newsscape videos into smaller segments, one for each TV show, with annotations of show title, channel, time, date. Currently, the most time-consuming process in the program is that of going frame by frame and extracting faces. We can speed up using multi-threading.
